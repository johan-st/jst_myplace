<h1 id="johan-strand">Johan Strand</h1>
<p> <em>a humble tech enthusiast</em> </p>
<h2 id="in-a-few-short-words-">In a few short words..</h2>
<p>..I am a generalist in the world with a keen interest tech and specifically in web technologies. I hope to embody a
    good mixture of humility and hubris and I thrive on feedback and I will cherish any well reasoned perspective.</p>
<h2 id="the-generalist-">The Generalist..</h2>
<p><em>..has a broad knowledge base to help compare, draw parallels to and understand a wide array of domains and
        viewpoints.</em></p>
<p>For as long as I can remember I have always been interested in tech. Early on my interest was nurtured by my father
    who for instance sat down with me and &quot;the little electrician&quot;, a kit of modular components and of
    projects including building an electrical engine, or building a microphone from basic components.</p>
<p>Since then, interesting physics and tech related knowledge mostly just clicked. And yes, I was the kind of kid who
    did a presentation on specific and general theory of relativity and was asked to present the topic to the physics
    class in year 12 of school. In short, somewhat of a nerd.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>some of my special interests:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>computer games (like; C&amp;C, AvP2, SC2, anything by Super Giant Games, etc..)</li>
        <li>&quot;board games&quot; (like; Hero/Star Realms, 7 wonders, Res Arcana, etc.. )</li>
        <li>science fiction literature (by; Asimov, Frank Herbert, Heinlein, Arthur C. Clarke, Orwell, H.G. Wells,
            Ursula K. Le Guin, William Gibson etc.)</li>
        <li>psychology of perception and intelligence.</li>
    </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I prefer focusing my learning on topics that are &quot;evergreen&quot;, i.e. protocols, data structures and Design
    Patterns instead of not any single library to abstract them and might be obsolete next year. (This is where learning
    and solving problems with go has become an asset. It usually do not abstract away from the underlying mechanics to
    much.)</p>
<p>I have built a basic understanding on a broad number of topics ranging from Theology to Neural Nets to Biology. I
    usually have a feeling for where to start looking for a solution to any given problem, what questions might need
    answering before proceeding etc.</p>
<h2 id="the-expert-">The Expert..</h2>
<p><em>..has deep knowledge and expertise that distinguishes him and provide unique insights</em>.</p>
<p>Today my most relevant point(s) of expertise are in web-technologies. I have touched a lot of technologies and I
    believe I have a good grasp of the fundamentals in computer science. This is sufficient for the problems I&#39;ve
    encountered so far and I have yet to encounter any truly difficult problem. Most challenges I&#39;ve tackled seam to
    stem from limited time/resources in combination with obscured/out-of-day/missing information and poor error handling
    and observability.</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>Currently I am playing with thoughts on how a bespoke business-rules-engine would be modelled and implemented on
        the BEAM.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My most immediate area of self improvement will be to dig deeper and solve more difficult problems.</p>

<h1 id="languages-and-tools">Languages and Tools</h1>
<p> <strong>Experienced</strong> with laguages and tool as those I will be up and runnig as soon as I gotten to know
    your codebase and specific tooling.</p>
<p> <strong>Some experience</strong> are those where I will need to work through a refresher but I am starting with some
    knowledge.</p>
<p> <strong>Not Mentioned</strong> tech and languages should at this point not be a major hinderance as I am comfident I
    can get up to speed on most tech in a resonable amount of time.</p>
